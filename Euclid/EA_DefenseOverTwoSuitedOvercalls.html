		<li>On ONLY when we open a Major:
		<ul>
			<li>1M (2NT) ?
		</ul>
		<li>Double<font color="red">!</font> shows a hand willing to penalize at least one of their suits
		<li>3<font color="black" size=+1>&clubs;</font><font color="red">!</font> good hand in O

			<li>Opener bids 2O with 3-card support

			<li>Else opener bids 2<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> (temporizing)
		</ol>
		<li>3<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font><font color="red">!</font> limit or limit+ in M
		<li>3<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font><font color="red">!</font> competitive.
		<ol type=1>
			<li>if hearts opened, then we would have bid 2<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font> without the interference
			<li>if spades opened, then it suggests a weakish long heart suit without spade support
		</ol>
		<li>3<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font><font color="red">!</font> competitive.

			<li>if spades opened, then we would have bid 2<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> without the interference

	<h3><li>Defense Vs Their Michaels</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<!--
		<li>We open a minor (1m-2m)
		<ol type=1>
			<li>2NT is invitational (10-12) with both majors stopped
			<li>3NT is 13-15 with both majors stopped
			<li>3 of our opened m is competitive (example 1C-2C-3C).
			<li>3M! is Western Cue with GF values and only 1 major stopped. So 1D-2D-3H! promises a spade stop and asks for 3NT with a heart stop. Granted they have not physically bid any majors so that the cue bid is 'invisible' but I think it is a consistent application of Western Cue
			<li>2M! is a mini-Western Cue with an invitational 10-12 HCP and only 1 major stopped. So 1D-2D-2H! shows invitational values, spades stopped but not hearts and implies some diamond support. So opener can bid 2NT with a stop but a min hand, 3NT with 14+ and a heart stop, or 3D without a heart stop (or even 4 or 5D I suppose).
			<li>double! for penalty with say 54 shape in the majors and 9+ HCP. They have nowhere to run is the theory.
		</ol>
		-->
		<li>On ONLY when we open a Major
		<ul>
			<li>1M (2M) ?
		</ul>
		<li>Cuebid of their known (Major) suit is limit or limit+ for our opened major.
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Opener's rebid shows whether he would have accepted a limit raise.
			<ul>
				<li>1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font> (2<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) 2<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font><font color="red">!</font> (p), 3<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font> shows partner would NOT have accepted a limit raise
				<li>1<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> (2<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font>) 3<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font><font color="red">!</font> (p), 3<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> show partner would NOT have accepted a limit raise
			</ul>
			<li>This is another 'invisible cue bid'.
			<li>Karen Walker cautions to be conservative here as suits will break badly. This means 3-card support is tenuous.
		</ol>
		<li>Jump cuebids<font color="red">!</font> or 4m<font color="red">!</font> are strong splinters and are slam tries in our opened major.
		<li>Double<font color="red">!</font> or NT shows all non-bigfit hands with 10+ HCP.
		<li>All other bids are non-forcing
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Competitive raises of our opened major
			<li>Free bids of new suits
		</ol>
