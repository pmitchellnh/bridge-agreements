<h1 align="center">Meckwell Escapes Over Penalty Double of 1NT</h1>

<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Defined:</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>Meckwell Escapes are used over any direct-seat penalty (or non-alerted) double of partner's 1NT opening or overcall.
   	<ul>
   		<li>1NT (*) ?
			<li> (1$) 1NT (*) ?
   	</ul>
		<li>Meckwell Escapes are also used over a balancing-seat double (of any kind) that has been passed back to responder.
   	<ul>
   		<li>1NT (p) p (*), p (p) ?
   	</ul>
		<li>The goal in both cases is to find a safe place to run, if necessary, at the two-level
		<li>Note that the only difference in the two situations is the juxtaposition of the pass<span class="alert">!</span> and redouble<span class="alert">!</span> bids.
