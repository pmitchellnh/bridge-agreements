<h1 align="center">Forcing 1NT</h1>

<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Defined</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>1NT Forcing is used as a response to partner's 1M opening with 6-12 HCP (or 5 support points with 3-card support for partner) and an inability to raise partner's suit.
		<li>It is announced as "Forcing", by an unpassed hand, in the same way that "Transfer" is announced.
		<li>It is announced as "Semi-Forcing" by a passed hand, meaning it can be passed by opener only with a balanced minimum.
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Rebids by opener</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>Bid 2 of major with 6-card suit and 15 or fewer HCP
		<li>Bid 3 of major with 6-card suit and 16+ HCP
		<li>Bid 2NT with 18-19 HCP, balanced.
		<li>1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>-1NT<font color="blue">!!</font>, 2<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> is a normal 16-21 reverse.
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Lebensohl is now ON.
		</ol>
		<li>With unbalanced 18+ (or 16+ with 5/5 shape), jump-shift to second suit.
		<li>Otherwise, bid a lower ranking suit at the 2-level.
		<ol type=a>
			<li>If hearts it must be 4+ in length.
			<li>A minor suit may be 3 cards in length.
			<li>Bid 2<font color="black" size=+1>&clubs;</font> rather than 2<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> if minors are of equal length.
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Responder's 2nd bid</h3>
   <ol type=1>
       <li>With 5 SP and 3-card support OR 6+ HCP and 2-card support, bid 2M (Bidding likely stops here)
       <li>With 3-card support for partner's opened major and 10-12 SP, bid 3M (3-card limit raise)
       <li>With 10-12 HCP and notrump distribution, bid 2NT invitationally.
      	<li>If opener bid your suit, you can pass, but you should raise it if you are at the high end.
       <li>Otherwise you have a weak hand with a long suit of your own. Bid it as cheaply as possible as a DROP-DEAD bid.
