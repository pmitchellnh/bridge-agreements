		Notes on formatting and symbols used on this card:<br><br>
		Suits are referred to by their first letter (S,H,D,C) or by their suit symbols:
			<span class="spade">&spades;</span>
			<span class="heart">&hearts;</span>
			<span class="diam">&diams;</span>
			<span class="club">&clubs;</span><br>
		'M' is an unspecified major (<span class="spade">&spades;</span> or <span class="heart">&hearts;</span>)<br>
		'm' is an unspecified minor (<span class="diam">&diams;</span> or <span class="club">&clubs;</span>)<br>
		'&' is any denomination (including NT)<br>
		'$' is any suit (excludes NT)<br>
		'O' is the other major, for sequences that include 'M', so 1M (2NT) 3O is either: <br>
			<blockquote>
		 	1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> (2NT) 3<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> or <br>
			1<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> (2NT) 3<span class="spade">&spades;</span><br>
			</blockquote>
		'o' is the other minor, for sequences that include 'm', so 1m - 1M, 1NT - 2o is either: <br>
			<blockquote>
			1<span class="club">&clubs;</span> - 1<span class="heart">&hearts;</span>, 1NT - 2<span class="diam">&diams;</span> or<br>

		<p>
		'*' means Double<br>
		'**' means Redouble<br>
		<p>
		"<span class="alert">!</span>" indicates an alerted bid, e.g.:
			<blockquote>
			1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 3<span class="club">&clubs;</span><span class="alert">!</span>
			</blockquote>
		"<span class="announce">!!</span>" indicates an announced bid, e.g.:
			<blockquote>
			1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 1NT<span class="announce">!!</span>
			</blockquote>
		<p>
		Bid sequences generally start with opener.<br>
		Passes are included where relevant (e.g., third and fourth hand openings).<br>
		Uncontested auctions are in the form [opener] - [responder], [opener] - [responder], with commas separating each round and opponents' passes being implicit, for example:<br>
			<blockquote>
			1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span>, 3<span class="diam">&diams;</span> - 4<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> or<br>
			p - 1<span class="spade">&spades;</span>, 2<span class="diam">&diams;</span><span class="alert">!</span> - 2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span><span class="alert">!</span>
			</blockquote>
		In contested auctions, opponents' bids will be in parentheses; passes will either be implicit, where obvious, or denoted by a 'p', for example: <br>
		<blockquote>
		1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> (2<span class="diam">&diams;</span>) 3<span class="diam">&diams;</span> (p), 4<span class="spade">&spades;</span>

		<!-- *********************************** -->
		<h3><a name="general"></a><li>General Approach - 2/1 Game Force</h3>

		<ol type=1>
			<li>Over any suit opening at the one-level, a natural, non-jumping two-level suit response by an unpassed hand is forcing to game.  This includes:
			<ul>
				<li>1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span><br>
				<li>1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 2<span class="diam">&diams;</span><br>
				<li>1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span><br>
				<li>1<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span><br>
				<li>1<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> - 2<span class="diam">&diams;</span><br>
				<li>1<span class="diam">&diams;</span> - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span> (with one exception, as follows)<br>
				<li>1<span class="diam">&diams;</span> - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span>, 2& - 3<span class="club">&clubs;</span> promises 10+ HCP and 6 clubs; game force is now OFF
			</ul>
			<li>When opponents interfere in a game-forcing auction, we either persist to game or they play doubled
			<ol type=a>
				<li>When the interfering bid immediately follows the responder's 2/1 bid, then opener has the following responsibilities:
				<ol type=i>
					<li>With a full opener and appropriate defense (at least two quick tricks), opener may pass or double
					<li>With a "Rule of 20" opener, appropriate only for offense, opener rebids suit (single-suiter) or bids a second suit (two-suiter)
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
