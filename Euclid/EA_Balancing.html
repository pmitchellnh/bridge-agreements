<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Balancing Overcalls Over One of a Suit</h3>
	<ol type=1>
    <li>Pass when weak (0-7 HCP) OR if long in the opponent's suit and it is your best suit.
    <li>Double when holding a strong NT (15+) OR any 8+ HCP short in the opponent's suit (partner may pass to convert to a penalty double)
    <ol type=a>
    	<li>Partner's response
    	<ol type=i>
    		<li>Pass for penalty (must be 12+ with 5 trumps)
    		<li>Non-jump bid 0-11 HCP
    		<li>2NT is 12-14 balanced, with at least 2 stoppers in opponent's suit.
    		<li>Jump in a suit shows 12+ HCP
    		<li>Cuebid shows 12+ HCP but no good suit and unwilling to bid NT.
    	</ol>
    	<li>Rebids by doubler
    	<ol type=i>
	    		<li>Pass a suit with 8-11 HCP
    		<li>Bid or raise with 12+ HCP
    		<li>Bid NT with the strong NT holding
    	</ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Overcall in a suit with 7+ HCP without shortness in the opponent's suit and with a bad suit somewhere.
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Balancing Over an Opponent's Fit at the Two Level</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>We must balance (bid or double) at matchpoints unless all three of the following are true:
    	<ol type=a>
    		<li>we are vulnerable (risk factor - going for minus 200).
    		<li>we have more than a singleton in the opponent's suit.
				<ul>
					<li>Increasing numbers of cards in their suit reduce our fit probability.
					<li>Shortness in their suit increases it.
				</ul>
    		<li>no 2-level balance is even theoretically possible.
				<ul>
					<li>A 3-level bid increases the chance of a penalty double.
				</ul>
    	</ol>
		<li>Examples of opponents showing a fit:
   	<ul>
   		<li>(1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) p (2<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) p, (p) ?
   		<li>(1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font>) p (1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) p, (2<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) p (p) ?
   	</ul>
</ol>
