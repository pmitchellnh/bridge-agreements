<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Defined</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>In response to partner's opening lead, any card played by third hand that is <i>not</i> an attempt to win the trick should be considered an obvious shift signal.
		<li>By this, we mean that a normally discouraging signal (high card) shows tolerance for the obvious shift suit. It does not necessarily deny support for the opened suit.
		<li>An encouraging signal denies tolerance for the obvious shift suit, and does not promise support for the opened suit.
	</ul>
	<h3><li>Determining the Obvious Shift Suit</h3>
	The obvious shift suit is determined by applying the following rules, in order, until a single suit is indicated:
	<ol type=1>
		<li>Eliminate the suit led.
		<li>Eliminate the trump suit.
		<li>Eliminate any suit in dummy headed by AKQ or KQJT or better.
		<li>Against a suit contract, eliminate any suit in dummy that is singleton or void.
		<li>Eliminate any suit bid naturally by declarer.
		<li>Choose the suit(s) that has been bid naturally by you or partner. If none, continue; if multiple, eliminate non-bid suits and continue
		<li>Suit only: Choose the three-card suit(s) in dummy headed by, at best, one honor
		<li>Choose the remaining suit(s) in which dummy is shortest (even if it's AK doubleton). If multiple, eliminate longer suits and continue
		<li>Choose the remaining suit(s) in which dummy has fewest honors.
		<li>Choose the lower-ranked of the remaining suits.
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Tolerance for the Obvious Shift Means:</h3>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
		<tr><th>If dummy's holding is:</th>
		<th>Then tolerance implies at least:</th></tr>
		<tr><td align="center">Axx</td>
		<td align="center">Qxx</td></tr>
		<tr><td align="center">Kxx</td>
		<td align="center">Qxx</td></tr>
		<tr><td align="center">Qxx</td>
		<td align="center">Kxx</td></tr>
		<tr><td align="center">Jxx or worse (suit)</td>
		<td align="center">Kxx</td></tr>
		<tr><td align="center">Jxx or worse (NT)</td>
		<td align="center">Qxx</td></tr>
		</table>
<p>
Note that tolerance of the obvious shift does not obligate opener to make such a shift.  All things must be evaluated in context.
