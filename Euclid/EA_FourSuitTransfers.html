<h1 align="center">Four Suit Transfers</h1>

<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Transfer to clubs or diamonds with</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>a 6-card minor bust
		<li>a 6-cd hand invitational to 3NT
		<ul>
			<li>as weak as xx xxx KQxxxx xx will make 3NT if opener has Axx and stoppers elsewhere
		</ul>
		<li>a 6-cd hand with slam interest
		<li>a 6-cd hand with legitimate doubt as to whether 3NT or 5m is a better game
		<li>use the diamond transfer with a weak 5/5 minors hand (pass any response)
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Transfer sequences</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>The first transfer
		<ol type=a>
			<li>2<span class="diam">&diams;</span><span class="announce">!!</span> and 2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span><span class="announce">!!</span> are Jacoby transfers as usual.
			<li>2<span class="spade">&spades;</span><span class="announce">!!</span> is a transfer to 3<span class="club">&clubs;</span>
			<ol type=i>
				<li>3<span class="club">&clubs;</span><span class="alert">!</span> postaccept
				<ul>
					<li>postaccept if you want to play 3NT should responder have the invitational hand (hand type 2 in the opening paragraph)
					<li>typically Qxx or xxxx or better
				</ul>
				<li>else bid 2NT<span class="alert">!</span>
			</ol>
			<li>2N<span class="alert">!</span> is a transfer to 3<span class="diam">&diams;</span>
			<ol type=i>
				<li>3<span class="diam">&diams;</span><span class="alert">!</span> postaccept
				<li>else bid 3<span class="club">&clubs;</span><span class="alert">!</span>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<li>Responder's second bid after a postaccept
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Pass is to play (bust hand)
			<li>3NT is to play and shows you had the invitational hand.
			<li>New suit<span class="alert">!</span> shows shortness.
			<ul>
				<li>Example: AKx xxx x AKxxxx, partner opens 1NT and you bid 2<span class="spade">&spades;</span><span class="alert">!</span>
				<li>Partner transfers to 3<span class="club">&clubs;</span>
				<li>You bid 3<span class="diam">&diams;</span><span class="alert">!</span> showing the diamond shortness.
				<li>Now 3NT by opener is to play and any other new suit is a cue.
				<li>Note that slam or 3NT or 5<span class="club">&clubs;</span> may still be the final contract in the example hand (you'd really like to hear 3<span class="heart">&hearts;</span>).
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<li>Responder's second bid after a NON-postaccept
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Pass of 3<span class="club">&clubs;</span> is to play (bust hand with 5-5 minors)
			<li>Complete the transfer<span class="alert">!</span> with a bust or invitational hand (A or B, above)
			<li>3NT is a strong balanced slam try
			<li>New suit<span class="alert">!</span> shows shortness (hand C or D, above)
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Stayman Subtleties</h3>
	<ol type =1>
		<li>Some minor adjustments are necessary since 1NT-2NT is not available any more or a simple invitation.
		<li>Such hands now go thru Stayman:
		<ol type=a>
			<li>1NT - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span>, 2<span class="diam">&diams;</span> - 2NT<span class="alert">!</span> might have 4-card major
			<li>1NT - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span>, 2<span class="spade">&spades;</span> - 2NT<span class="alert">!</span> might have 4 hearts
			<li>1NT - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span>, 2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> - 2NT<span class="alert">!</span> denies a 4-card major
			<li>1NT - 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span>, 2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span> - 2<span class="spade">&spades;</span><span class="alert">!</span> shows 4 spades, 8-9 HCP
		</ol>
	</ol>
</ol>
