		<li>Manfield is a convention played over an opponent's double of opener's 1M

  <h3><li>Responses</h3>
    <ol type=1>
      <li>Redouble<span class="alert">!</span> = 8+ HCP and no big fit (i.e., 3-card support or less)
        <ul>
        <li>Alertable, as it could show fewer than 10 points
          <li>If 8 or 9, then must have 2-card support for opener.
        </ul>
      <li>1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> (over 1<span class="heart">&hearts;</span>) shows 4 spades (not common)
      <li>1NT<span class="alert">!</span> = relay to 2<span class="club">&clubs;</span><span class="alert">!</span> by opener, followed by:
      <ul>
        <li>Pass<span class="alert">!</span> or 2<span class="diam">&diams;</span><span class="alert">!</span> = weak minor, to play (6-card suit)

        </ul>
        <li>Over an interfering bid (e.g., 1<span class="spade">&spades;</span> (x) 1NT (2<span class="heart">&hearts;</span>)
        <ul>
          <li>Any action by opener must presume that partner was relaying to the weak minor, and would thus have to show extraordinary strength and/or shape (e.g., 5-0-4-4).
          <li>Assuming opener passes, 3M<span class="alert">!</span> by responder shows the 3-card limit raise, and
          <li>Double<span class="alert">!</span> shows the 4-card raise with a void.
          <ul>
            <li>2NT<span class="alert">!</span> (or 3NT<span class="alert">!</span>) by opener asks where; if hearts is trump, 3<span class="heart">&hearts;</span><span class="alert">!</span> (or 4<span class="heart">&hearts;</span><span class="alert">!</span>) shows spade void.
