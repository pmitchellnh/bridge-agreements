<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Simple (non-jump) Suit Overcalls</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>One-Level. An overcall of 1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font>, 1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>, or 1<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> promises:
		<ol type=a>
			<li>At least a 5-card suit that you would not be ashamed to have partner lead if we wind up on defense.
			<ul>
				<li>Overcall with a suit like Axxxx, KQxxx, KJTxx, QJ9xx
				<li>Do NOT overcall with Kxxxx, Q9xxx, Jxxxxx. Save these hands for possible balancing later
				<li>Balancing does NOT require a good suit and is NOT lead-directing
			</ul>
			<li>7-17 HCP 
			<ul>
				<li>If only 7, then ALL, or nearly all, the HCP should be in the overcalling suit
				<li>AKxxx or AQJxx or KQJTx with an outside jack
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<li>Two-Level. An overcall at the 2-level promises:
		<ol type=a>
			<li>A suit like that discussed in A1a, above.
			<li>9-17 HCP
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Responding to Partner's Simple Overcall</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>If RHO passes
    <ol type=a>
        <li>Responses with a fit
        <ol type=i>
        	<li>Less than 6 SP, pass
        	<li>6-10 SP, raise partner.
        	<li>11+ SP with 4+ trump support, cue bid opponent's suit. 
        	<ul>
        		<li>Overcaller should repeat suit as cheaply as possible with minimum overcall
        		<li>Overcaller should jump in suit or bid a second suit with a max overcall
        	</ul>
        	<li>16+ SP, bid game
        	<li>5-card support (major) or 6-card support (minor) with a singleton or void elsewhere, bid game.
        	<li>4-card support, weak and distributional, jump raise, preemptively
        </ol>
        <li>Responses without a fit and with a balanced hand and with a stopper in opponent's suit
        <ol type=i>
        	<li>10-12 HCP, bid NT as cheaply as possible.
        	<li>12-14 HCP, jump to 2NT from 1-level or just bid 2NT if already at 2-level.
        	<li>15+ HCP, bid 3NT
        </ol>
        <li>Responses without a fit and with 8+ HCP
        <ol type=i>
        	<li>Strive to find a bid as partner may have 17 and a game is on. 
        	<li>Note: a jump shift would be a weak jump shift<font color="red">!</font>
        </ol>
        <li>Otherwise Pass.
    </ol>
		<li>If RHO bids, responses same as above except:
		<ol type=a>
			<li>11+ SP with a fit:
			<ol type=i>
				<li>with 3+ trump support, cuebid opponents' first (opened) suit
				<li>with 4+ trump support, cuebid opponents' second (responded) suit
			</ol>
			<li>References to opponents' suit are now suit(s)
		</ol>
