<ol type=A>
	<h3><li>Negative Doubles</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>When used?
		<ol type=a>
			<li>This double is a tool of responder only and is never used by opener or overcallers.
			<li>It is set up when partner opens and RHO overcalls in a suit at or below 3<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font>. 
			<li>A double by responder is now a negative double.
			<li>A double of an opponent's overcall over 3<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> is penalty.
			<li>A double of an opponent's 1NT or 2NT overcall is penalty.
		</ol>
		<li>Strength (unlimited at high end)
		<ol type=a>
			<li>if at 1-level, shows 6+ HCP
			<li>if at 2-level, shows 8+ HCP
			<li>if at 3-level, shows 10+ HCP
		</ol>
		<li>Shape
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Shows 4 cards in unbid major(s) and tolerance (3 cards) for unbid minors.
			<li>Examples:
			<ul>
				<li>1<font color="black" size=+1>&clubs;</font> (1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font>) * = two 4-card majors and 6+ HCP
				<li>1<font color="black" size=+1>&clubs;</font> (1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font>) 1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font> = 4 hearts and less than 4 spades, because you would negative double with 4 of each.
				<li>1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> (1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) * = 4 spades, 3+ clubs and 6+ HCP
				<li>1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> (1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>) 1<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font> = 5 spades and 6+ HCP. Note that you must have 5 spades for this bid.
				<li>1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> (2<font color="black" size=+1>&clubs;</font>) * = two 4-card majors and 8+ HCP
				<li>1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font> (2<font color="black" size=+1>&spades;</font>) * = two 4-card minors (when no majors are indicated by the double, minors should be 4+) and 8+ HCP
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<li>Frequently asked questions
		<ol type=a>
			<li>What to do with a trump stack in overcaller's suit? 
			<ul>
				<li>Pass and wait for the reopening double (see section C, below).
			</ul>
			<li>What to do with points but inability to negative double due to bad shape? Example: you have Axxx Qx Kxxx xx, partner opens 1<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> and RHO overcalls 1<font color="red" size=+1>&hearts;</font>. 
			<ul>
				<li>Bid 2<font color="red" size=+1>&diams;</font> because you don't have tolerance for clubs.  It is important to communicate your values.
			</ul>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Opener's Rebid After a Negative Double</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>Which suit?
		<ol type=a>
			<li>With four cards in either of the unbid suits, bid that suit
			<li>Rebid own suit with a long strong suit
			<li>Bid notrump with a stopper in the opponent's suit
			<li>Choose between the unbid suits even with only three cards in the suit
		</ol>
		<li>How high? 
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Opener must, after the double, bid the full extent of his/her hand
			<li>With a minimum (13-15), make a min bid
			<li>With good hand (16-19 points), jump the bid
			<li>With a maximum hand (20-21 points) bid game or cuebid opponent's suit.
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<h3><li>Reopening Double.</h3>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>When used?
		<ol type=a>
			<li>This is a tool of opener only. Never by responder or overcallers.
			<li>It is set up when you open, LHO overcalls, partner passes and RHO passes. 
			<li>A double by you is now a reopening double.
			<li>You strain to reopen on the auction above in order to protect partner's ability to punish the overcall. 
			<li>Exceptions:
			<ol type=a>
				<li>you are long in opponent's suit so partner cannot have a trump stack and must have passed out of weakness (ie: you hold 4+ cards)
				<li>you are highly distributional - a one-suiter or you opened on the Rule of 20. This implies that your hand is not suitable for defense as you are 
short in high cards in the side suits.
				<li>With 1 or 2 cards in enemy suit, strain to reopen with a double and then lead trump when in.
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<li>When should responder leave in a reopening double?
		<ol type=a>
			<li>Leave the double in when you meet the 'Rule of 9' (If tricks bid by opponent + #cards in their suit + #honors in their suit add to 9 or more). 
			<li>Opener should strive to lead trump if possible when on lead.
			<li>Otherwise clarify your hand with another bid, which opener will read as weak.
